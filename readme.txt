Tantalum 5 Library Release Notes
March 15, 2013

You need to create an IDE project after checkout. Since IDEs include user-specific
settings in project files, we can not provide one directly. Note that is is strongly
advised you create this project in a different directory than your git checkout.
For example, if you did git clone into directory <myhomedir>/Tantalum you might want
to have the project in the default directory for projects for your IDE such as 
<myhomedir>/nokia_eclipse or <myhomedir>/NetBeansProjects.

The latest source can be pulled from the respository using git. The
cross-platform example is released seperately and can be found from the link below.
